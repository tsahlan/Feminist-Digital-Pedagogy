# Session Plan

- Keywords: theory and/as praxis; failure; literacies; (in)visibility; community; ethics; labor

- Month in review: grounding theories, goals and guiding principles; beginning to build a best practices reference guide

- Instructor contributions for the session on **mapping communitiessuggestion:** An [assignment](https://eng295.commons.gc.cuny.edu/project-3/) and example projects [Blast to The Past (Bronx Edition)](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=f8fd66bd0ce24601bfd43f90eada533e) and [Churches of East New York Brooklyn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJiTmA6NjAg); on **digital editing suggestion:** An [article that includes the assignment](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/yc_pubs/322/) and the [project](https://scalar.usc.edu/works/shakespeare-in-the-digital-age/index).
- Question: What are some of the contexts/background knowledge students may need to be introduced to when they evaluate and build projects with a feminist and/or queer focus? In other words, what would be the necessary balance between **theory** and technical **skill** in a course that takes such topics into consideration? 
 
# Session Notes

## Questions related to readings

What does teaching/assignments/workshops that “challenge power” (D’Ignazio and Klein) look like?
    
## Discussion
- What does/can queering DH / DH pedagogy look like?
  - What narratives does this tool best serve? What does it do that I don’t like and how could I use it against its promoted use?
  - Engaging learners in building counter narratives, ask how they repurpose a tool for a new purpose
    - Can lower barrier of entry for digital creation, digital literacy
  - If a tool is unsuccessful finding ways to repurpose it
  - **Counter-uses suggestion**: E.g. Using Excel for art, counter-uses
    - [Excel esports](https://fmworldcup.com/microsoft-excel-world-championship/)
    - [Wilderness.land](https://wilderness.land/)

### Project Discussion 
What kinds of assignments/labs would need to be scaffolded to achieve a (potentially personal, community-driven) final project like [Locating Queer Memories](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/512dbf55af5647fba8ef7ea629d353cd)? 

1. First, a reflective assignment on thinking about maps:
  - How are all maps curated? How is truth conveyed and concealed? How can maps reinforce or challenge existing power structures?
  - Maps as mediums → cartographical, scientific, sites of memory, sites of imagining, memes, etc… what can maps communicate that other mediums can not?
  - **Share examples of cool, funny, niche maps**
  - Ask students to choose a favorite map of theirs to share with others
   -exploring maps in/as digital
    - Sharing examples of different projects and the tools they use / built
   
2. Second, a brainstorm session for mapping narratives:
  - What kind of story do you want to tell with your project?
  - Themes, locations, experiences you wish to express, things you wish for people (or yourself) to get from your project
  - At the end, encourage students to think about how the outcomes and experiences they wish to reflect from their narrative will shape the instrumental nature of their project.
    - How do you want people to engage with the project? Contribute? Or learn about?

3. Proposal assignment

4. Tinkering sessions
  - MM: mixing in tinkering with proposal stage; looking at examples and remixing

  - I think this would need to involve building skills from early around the tools being used for the final project (and going even broader, maybe selecting tools together as a class early on - this way things like avoiding ArcGIS due to military contracts could be taken into account to ensure a wide range of tools are available so there’s options everyone feels safe and comfortable using) and *also* **building skills early on around engaging critically with the content that will be included - how to do historical research, how to center the voices of those who have been historically oppressed, etc.** I’d imagine that these two streams of learning would be pretty separate in the beginning, since it’s tricky enough just to learn the basics of research methodology or a new tool on their own. Maybe alternating weeks - one week focuses on historical research, one on learning the tools, repeat. But as the class goes on there could be more intersection - for example a practice project on the tool learning side could use the output of the previous week’s research activity and the assignment could be displaying some aspect of that with the tool. This way, the progression feels natural to students, and combining the skills from both “sides” of the class has become a habit, so by the time they get to the final project, it just feels like a culmination of all of that.

How would you assess an assignment like [Queer Memories](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/512dbf55af5647fba8ef7ea629d353cd)? (here I'm interested in what you would look for/what to evaluate rather than what letter grade you’d give this project) 
 - Does it balance intimacy, privacy (if necessary), and world building? Does data, testimony, or ephemera come from the people involved in the community. Authenticity is important to depicting the fullness of a world or community.
 - Does it present an alternate version of history, reclaim events or territory, counter a prevailing narrative, etc. Who are the subjects? 
 - Can the choices made in design or in tools used advance the counter narrative or history being presented? In Queer Memories, different colored markers are used to present the different narratives.
 - In a project like this, is the project’s goal to tread new ground in uncovering or documenting underrepresented narratives/lives, has it engaged with that topic in a more critically focused lens than previous attempts.
 - Is the project asking new questions of the archive process if that was how they sourced their data and narratives
 - What were the questions they asked when deciding on which technology to use to tell this particular story - what negotiations did they have to make to make their narrative fit within their technical (and time) limits. What was gained, what was lost? Were the end results worth it.
 - If this is presented as a DH project, what steps were taken to document the process of this project for replication.
 - How well did they document the labor and the breakdown of labor involved in this project. If the team changed over time, is that visible in the documentation?

 
 ### Pedagogical Best Practices

What are some concrete ways we can center affect and emotionality in learning environments and projects?
  - Respect. No emotion is wrong to have, but it’s important to explore where those emotions might stem from to push back against “gut instincts” that may get in the way of exploring something more critically. Basically - allowing students a space to be honest (if they feel comfortable doing so) about how a project is making them feel so they can examine those emotions further - either to try and get past some that may be blocking them, or to incorporate the ones that motivate them more into the project.
- Curiosity
  - ZM: Curiosity is modeled
- Productive discomfort (with kindness)
- TA: The banking system fights against this centering -- we need community-building
- Co-creating assignments, rubrics, goals 
- Sitting with and interrogating all emotions, even boredom and disinterest 
- Whose truth is being presented/defended in a given tool/project?

Best practices, cont.: What does teaching/assignments/workshops that “challenge power” (D’Ignazio and Klein) look like?
- Co-liberation kept coming up for D’Ignazio and Klien and this reminds me of our initial classes when we spoke about community engagement. It also makes me think of how to avoid the deficit narrative. Co-liberation in the classroom or workshop would look like the co-learning
- Frier and hooks teach us. Engaging in dialogue, carving spaces for contribution, scaffolding to empower a detachment from the banking system.
- Some projects can be ephemeral, we should discuss with learners how long something should stay online and how people want to be credited
- Documentation should be a best practice from the start -- thinking about documentation preservation, sunsetting, citation
- TJ: projects as plays (LOVEEEE)
  - Documentation as playbills

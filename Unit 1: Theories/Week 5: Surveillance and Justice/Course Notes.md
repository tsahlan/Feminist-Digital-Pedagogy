# Session Plan

- Discuss the readings
- **Resource Suggestions on Surveillance**
  - Book: [Perfect Victims and the Politics of Appeal](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/2499-perfect-victims)
  - Project: [Detroit Digital Justice Coalition](https://www.detroitdjc.org/)
  - Article: [Against Cop Shit](https://jeffreymoro.com/blog/2020-02-13-against-cop-shit/)
- Explore a project together
- Questions:
    - How can we learn to question what intention is behind a piece of technology? How is that intention embedded in the fabric of digital architecture?
    - How does “crime” and “safety” help to justify the existence and expansion of the surveillance / stalker state? How can we resist these buzz words being introduced to manipulate the public into normalizing such things?

 
# Session Notes

## Questions related to readings

Benjamin writes about Stop LAPD Spying Coalition:**How can community knowledge and empowerment against the use and normalization of mass surveillance tech tools (paired with labor organizing) provide a robust foundation for resisting algorithmic oppression? How has knowledge helped communities resist ICE, while we build greater systems of protection for and amongst ourselves?**
  - Labor and communities

    
## Discussion
Why does the internet never forget? How is the internet shaped by surveillance capitalism? How can we re-envision an internet that is anonymous, forgetful, messy, etc.?
  - Publicly owned resources → rebalancing of existing resources

As you did the readings, what were some topics that you were ready to engage with? What were some topics that were difficult for you to engage with? How can we push people outside of their comfort to engage with topics of surveillance, without having them freeze?
  - Unexpected surveillance → version control on docs
    - Weighing benefits vs. the malicious…
  - The metadata is there… sometimes accessible to you
  - The way we surveil each other
    - “Stalking” their ex’s
    - Finding out information about people from your past
    - Digging up people

Social media filter bubbles assignments – what did you think about it?
  - Visualizing filters was interesting, engaging students directly
  - Perhaps give students time to get around it rather than just understand the problem
    - Implement at least 1 strategy as part of the class → make space for the changes
  - Search similar things or topics, to see the different sources that come up
    - Guiding students through a targeted route
  - Finding ways contextualize the massive amounts of data
    - Make it more physical and tangible to try and grasp
    - Granularized
  - Exploring *Spotify Wrapped*… make your own version!


### Project Discussion 
Lets explore [The Algorithm](whatsthealgorithm.com)
  - Cool, demystifying digital humanities project
  - What did you learn about algorithms and how they work?
  - What questions arose as you engaged with the project?
  - How could we build the internet in ways that are more transparent / demystifying as we engage with it?
  - How does this project inspire you?
 
 ### Pedagogical Best Practices

What are some creative ways of pedagogically engaging students in their communities when they think about and challenge surveillance?

Oftentimes, new technologies are developed under the guise of use for particular reasons… What questions can we ask to critically think about how technologies can extend beyond their alleged use? What are some examples you can think of that we can point to?

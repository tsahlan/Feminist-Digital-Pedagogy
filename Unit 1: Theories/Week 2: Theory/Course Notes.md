# Session Notes 
## Questions related to readings
“Work by women of color and marginalized groups or white women (for example, lesbians, sex radicals), especially if written in a manner that renders it accessible to a broad reading Teaching to Transgress public, is often de-legitimized in academic settings, even if that work enables and promotes feminist practice. Though such work is often appropriated by the very individuals setting restrictive critical standards, it is this work that they most often claim is not really theory … They use it to set up unnecessary and competing hierarchies of thought which reinscribe the politics of domination by designating work as either inferior, superior, or more or less worthy of attention.” (hooks 64-5) **Still the case! How to combat it in the classroom + building digital projects?**

Any of us who create feminist theory and feminist writing in academic settings in which we are continually evaluated know that work deemed “not scholarly” or “not theoretical” can result in one not receiving deserved recognition and reward. **-- this  connects with Croxall and Jackaki → how to combat this actively in a course syllabus?**

“No pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption. “ (Freire 54) **What is the duty of DH/pedagogy in relation to this?**

“The conviction of the oppressed that they must fight for their liberation is not a gift bestowed by the revolutionary leadership, but the result of their own conscientização” **-- how do we bring class/gender consciousness into the classroom and in dealing with digital tools in particular?**

## Discussion 

- MM's blog reminded me of some of my first realizations as a teacher and the notion of using technology in teaching. Some important key words were “critical” , “first Gen in higher ed”, “marginalized”, “ stuck with a tool”, “problem solving”.
- Something that came up in a few blog posts (CK’s, MM’s) was the idea of using technology only when it’s necessary, not just because it’s there. This generally connects to an idea throughout the readings of the learning process as ideally being collaborative between students, instructors, and anyone else involved - and this includes tailoring technological tools to work for everyone instead of inflicting a tech thing on a class for no good reason.
- I liked this quote from ZM’s blog: “By denying the value of asking questions, there is a reinforcement of knowledge as having to exist in a specific way, and we shame ourselves for not understanding things the first time they are presented to us.” It reminds me of this comic that I’ve seen referenced a lot when talking about people not knowing things: [Ten Thousand](https://xkcd.com/1053/) and how important the idea of being excited about other people learning and asking questions is instead of being frustrated they don’t know something.
- Creating community among students - classrooms as a place of friends
- Reciprocity in and out of classrooms
- “How could the tools and values of digital humanities make theory and education more accessible to people who have a knee jerk reaction away from the educational institutions that have wronged them in the past? “ - TJ
    - more emphasis on actively creating and sustaining public scholarship within DH
- “Balancing breadth with depth” - ZM
    - setting a solid footing for a tool helps with that comfort, and maybe (and has been the case for me) students (learners) will feel empowered to explore on their own
    - we need a culture of slow and curiosity back. I’ve also had the experience of students not feeling comfortable asking for extra help, but that is what their professors and staff are there for. lol I’ve had to give adjuncts advice on how to nudge out questions from students. I love that in many of my DH course prof are more aware of this and offer more than one way to contribute and get comfortable asking for help.
- “High Ed institutions are an ecosystem of sorts.” and mentions of emotional labor - JB
    - the ecosystem is super unhealthy is some places, and there’s an unequal amount of duty on some parts
    - yes the emotional labor is rough
- Adjuncts are not paid for all their labor - same with ed tech (especially!)
- Awareness of a learning curve of tech is important -- but also needs to be accounted for
    - Extra labor burden on students and instructors to know the tech and learn on their own
- Messing around, trial and error, not usual/encouraged in HE +no one becomes the “guru” (nor needs to)
- “People want to contribute in different ways and we need to give them different avenues to contribute” - MM
- "What do you lose when you try to scale up or make things look shiny and new?" - ZM
- "The challenge of having universal approaches/methods when everyone comes from different backgrounds." - CK
- **Book Suggestion:** [What Tech Calls Thinking by Adrian Daub](https://www.adriandaub.com/books/what-tech-calls)
- “Things were set up for the few success stories and not a successful community.” -- how to do successful communities? - MM
    - "Getting rid of grades!" - ZM
    - Creating comfort, judgement free zones
    - Centering students and their own goals for the class
    - Avoiding a system of punishment
    - Add a deliberate line in your syllabus that you are “co-learning” with them
    - Ungrading 
    - How do we make the classroom a place of curiosity
- **Blog Suggestion** [Innovation and Burnout](https://gclibrary.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2019/03/05/innovation-and-burnout-perspectives-on-open-pedagogy-from-an-adjunct/)
- Theory = putting your values into practice
- DH - important to be critical but also for it to be a place where people enjoy their explorations

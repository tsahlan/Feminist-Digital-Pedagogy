# Session Notes

## Questions related to readings

In Boyles there is this quote: 
   
There is an inherent violence in archival work — silencing and obscuring of people and sources, creating and sustaining hierarchies through collection practices that value some voices and experiences over others, through naming practices, controlled vocabularies, and description, as well as hiding/devaluing the labor involved in this work […] How can we deconstruct this silencing and archival violence, to build an anti-violent, anti-racist, woman-ist, practice instead?  [Lindblad 2018]
   
What are you thoughts on this quote?
    
## Discussion
- Emojis/Slack: can help build community, internal vocabulary, reactions are low-barrier way to show engagement/emotional acknowledgement 
- Work and academic Slacks are different but can use different strategies
- Can emoji be used as a way of affective pedagogy and form of multimodal composition
- We have to be careful not lay too many expectations on what spaces like Slack can do
    - But the use described in the article is a form of subversion of its intended use
- **Flattened hierarchies -- but beware of boundaries! We don’t want to push the personal boundary where people are expected to be “always on”  (JB/MM/group discussion)**
    - Reflect on the power and privilege structure when setting up a virtual community
    - Power dynamics will still be at play: folks experiencing less privilege may not find themselves comfortable rejecting the participation
    - Boundaries and expectations are always crucial when it comes to collaboration across departments, with librarians, with students, with other colleagues
    - Discuss early what the expectations for usage/engagement are and walk people through how to turn off or mute notifications
- But there’s a limit to how many applications folks are willing or have the bandwidth to use
- Setting up a Slack must have a really intentional purpose and use behind it, otherwise people won’t use it; it will lay dormant
    - Important to set up and maintain the community
    - Collaborate with the class/group on best practices and community rules
    - Group chat and discussion can offer a sense of privacy because phone

- This project is audio collage responding to an archival experience
    - [Audio Collage Assignment](https://works.hcommons.org/records/z0qmj-ce523)

 
 ### Pedagogical Best Practices

- How do we navigate resistance to adding yet another platform to the learning environment (TA)?
    - MM: onboarding experience has to be positive and showcase how and why the tool will be used
    - Labor is a serious consideration: people juggling multiple courses can find it overwhelming 
- Library article brought up questions of collaboration and what it means to work across hierarchies: e.g. working with undergraduate students as a graduate student: are you treating the student as a worker, or as a collaborator?
    - Important to collaborate on setting boundaries
- **Suggested Resource** Refer to [The Student Collaborators Bill of Rights](https://humtech.ucla.edu/news/a-student-collaborators-bill-of-rights/)
- When bringing a guest into a classroom or learning space, prepare learners for receiving and engaging the guest with patience, care, respect

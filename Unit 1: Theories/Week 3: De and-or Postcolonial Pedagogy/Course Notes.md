# Session Notes

## Discussion
- TJ: How much can individuals really be expected to take on the emotional labor of supporting their colleagues and students? Does this require a restructuring of schools and research institutions in general to provide an environment and a community that ensures students can be not just intellectually but also emotionally supported?

-  MM: Let’s consider the idea that “DH pedagogy in postcolonial sites must focus on the development of digital intellect as opposed to digital intelligence.”
    - Measures of intelligence often based on someone else’s testing -- intellect can be built and made personal and individualized
    - Building intellect can be an invitation to reimagine the future
    - Creating new concepts means we don’t have to be concerned with fitting in or belonging but can be centered around community from the start
    - When we don’t have a term for something, sometimes it can facilitate conversation -- naming something shows what we’re centering in a conversation
    - Social media connection kind of erases the need for a shared vocabulary (or vocabulary can be prismatic, visual, dispersed)

- JB: I’ve been thinking about visibility. I like that DH isn’t as visible right now. I like that DH isn’t clearly defined. Decolonial theory and praxis within DH can be hidden in a way by the vagueness of DH. 
    - So many ways to understand and define DH
    - Given current politics, DH  allows us to hide/work covertly -- whereas known term can be searchable
    - MM: negotiation of visibility and invisibility: archiving and documenting must be done with care so as to not put communities at risk -- crucial to reflect on privilege and power (who can speak, who can be seen, who should be documented
    - **Article Suggestion** Moya Bailey writes about this ( visibilty and invisibilty) in ["#transform(ing)DH Writing and Research: An Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics"](http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/9/2/000209/000209.html)
    - **Article Suggestion** from Black Feminisms.com on power ["The Matrix of Domination and the Four Domains of Power"](https://blackfeminisms.com/matrix/)
    - **Project Suggestion** CK: A project on canners in NYC. An example of archiving and documentation. [We Can NYC](https://canners.nyc/)
    - MM: One idea--keeping records but not necessarily publishing them when at risk
    - **Project Suggestion** Also working on projects that expose damage but not the people being targeted: [Torn Apart](https://xpmethod.columbia.edu/torn-apart/volume/2/index)
    - Looking at archives of previous moments in history where similar activism takes place

- Instructor, riffing on MM's post:  Let’s make a case for working in failure in DH classes. What does that look like in practice? i.e. assignments, readings, grading.

- Risam talks about using cultural specificity over universality as a way to practice decolonizing. How might we honor cultural specificity and individual experience when we may be teaching in large classrooms without risking generalizations about individual cultures or burnout?

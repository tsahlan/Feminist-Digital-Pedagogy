# Session Notes

## Discussion
- TJ: How much can individuals really be expected to take on the emotional labor of supporting their colleagues and students? Does this require a restructuring of schools and research institutions in general to provide an environment and a community that ensures students can be not just intellectually but also emotionally supported?

-  MM: Let’s consider the idea that “DH pedagogy in postcolonial sites must focus on the development of digital intellect as opposed to digital intelligence.”
    - Measures of intelligence often based on someone else’s testing -- intellect can be built and made personal and individualized
    - Building intellect can be an invitation to reimagine the future
    - Creating new concepts means we don’t have to be concerned with fitting in or belonging but can be centered around community from the start
    - When we don’t have a term for something, sometimes it can facilitate conversation -- naming something shows what we’re centering in a conversation
    - Social media connection kind of erases the need for a shared vocabulary (or vocabulary can be prismatic, visual, dispersed)
 
    - JB:

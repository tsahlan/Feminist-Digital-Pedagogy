# Feminist Digital Pedagogy
This is an archive of the course material, including syllabus, course notes, and students' input. DHUM 7400 Spring 2025 was offered at the Graduate Center, CUNY as a course in the M.A. in Digital Humnanitities and cross-listed in the M.A in Women's and Gender Studies. This archive was created to embody feminist citation, minimal computing, and share knowledge creation with other pedegogues interested in feminist digital pedagogy. Student names have been redacted. Student initials will be used to 
## Course Outline
### Week 1 Readings 
- Reading: Syllabus

**Description**
Students will examine the economic, social, and intellectual history of the design and use of technology. This course will focus particularly on the power of digital pedagogy as intersectional feminist praxis, which aims to centralize race, gender, class, and queer perspectives in academic debates. Readings in the course will focus on the history and development of the uses of technology in the classroom and academia alongside current attempts to critique how technology can reproduce structures of power and systems of oppression. We will also explore the unique ways digital humanities has transformed the classroom, and collaborate in defining clear goals for using and teaching new technologies, from engaging students in digital project analyses to teaching code and markup languages. Assignments for this course will include the development of shared resources for teaching and learning with technology, evaluations of projects with pedagogical components, as well as forays into project-based learning within fields such as digital editing, preservation and curation, and gaming.

**Credit/Grading**
3 crs. Grades are assessed holistically based on timely submission of critically-engaging work. This means that if you’re not turning in strong work I may be asking you to revise and resubmit it, but otherwise we’re operating on a “contract” style grade format: if you turn in all the required work for the course and you make sustained efforts to progress, you will earn at least a B. Higher grades will depend on strength of writing and level of critical engagement. Much of the work in this class will be a combination of experimentation and play, though this does not mean your work should not be thoughtful and critical. 

In this course we will learn and model a praxis of care, which of course applies across the board to both instructors and learners. If you require accommodations or if at any point life gets in the way of your completing this course, please reach out as soon as possible and we will figure out some alternatives together.

**Instruction Mode**

**This is a hybrid course**. We will have scheduled 2-hour in-person and occasional Zoom meetings (see schedule) to discuss our impressions of texts and go over digital projects together. **Attendance in these face to face meetings is required**, but do contact me if unforeseen circumstances make it difficult for you to attend or regularly participate. A set of shared course notes will be available for us to document group discussions, links, and ideas. Additional discussion and short writing will take place over our course blog.

**Learning Outcomes**

Participants in this course will:

1. Learn and apply best practices for teaching (with) digital technologies
2. Reflect on the role of feminist pedagogy within/as digital humanities
3. Develop a course unit or an assignment that incorporates digital technology with an eye toward community, care, and archiving
4. Evaluate, support, and share resources on digital tools for teaching and research
5. Identify and implement liberatory strategies for anti-racist, intersectional digital pedagogy

**Assignments**

This is a course on pedagogy, so we will take every opportunity to reflect on pedagogical choices, including our syllabus and our use of various digital platforms within the course. I consider the course schedule below a work in progress: our goals might change depending on what your goals are. The **core assignment in this course is the development of your pedagogical materials for a future class**. This can mean developing a course unit around a particular skill (say, scholarly editing); a single, scaffolded assignment employing a particular tool or methodology; or a list of supporting materials on a given topic. Ancillary activities to this project include a 1-page written proposal and 1-page rationale outlining the theories and methodologies motivating the assignment. We will discuss this assignment further around week 10.

Small, recurring assignments consist of:

*Formal blogs*: weekly formal analysis of assigned readings reflecting on their value to your pedagogical praxis. Blogs are formally due on midnight the day before class, with a grace period of 12 hours so I have time to read and comment on your work. Complete any 7/10. 

*Discussion Leader/Participation*: students are required to join class in person or online weekly and share ideas as we grapple with readings, potential assignment ideas, and methodologies. Most weeks, one student will sign up to prepare discussion questions to help us engage with our course readings and provide us with examples of assignments (you can use [Humanities Commons] (https://hcommons.org/) or [Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities] (https://digitalpedagogy.mla.hcommons.org/)).

*Alternative assignment*: we have two blank weeks in the semester. If you’d like to volunteer to set up the course readings and projects for a week (after consulting with the class on topics), you can do this in lieu of discussion leader. In addition to setting up the work due (including a blog prompt), you will submit a short, 1-page rationale for your choices. This work is due at least 1 week before class meets to discuss the assigned work. 
*Workshop*: once during the term each student will be responsible for becoming familiar with a tool useful to digital pedagogy and introducing it to the class. Your demo should offer a brief lesson on how to use the tool (aimed at an audience of your choice) and a list of suggestions for how to incorporate it in teaching contexts.

In order to prepare ourselves for a productive discussion, I encourage you to use our Course Notes as a central, communal space to ask questions, highlight sections for discussion, and add links or connections to other readings. I will also try to invite some guest speakers for special lectures.

**Required Technology**
Computer and internet access are required. Additional platforms include:

**CUNY Academic Commons**: Students must have a cuny.edu account to register. You will receive an invitation and I will go over the course site during Week 1.

**Zoom**: I will be using Zoom for 1:1 student meetings and for online class meetings. Use of video on Zoom is not required, though you will need to have your mic turned on. Please email me if you’d like an appointment to discuss anything class, DH, or feminist theory related, at any time.

**Fundamental standard & honor code**
I expect you to treat one another in this class not only with respect, but with generosity. If you find a resource or an approach that has helped you, share it so others can benefit — and listen when others share. We will have multiple spaces to facilitate this. Please use them thoughtfully and respectfully. Playfulness, joy, and constructive criticism are welcome. Hatred, abuse, or discrimination are not.  

Respecting people’s names and pronouns is not optional. I will – gently – correct you each time you make a mistake and while I do not expect the same in return (it is my responsibility, as the instructor, to ensure I am using the names and pronouns you all request and not actively causing you harm), I do welcome it. Slurs and racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, and/or ableist language will not be welcome in this space.

Collaboration — with your classmates and others — is very much welcome in this course, but be sure to acknowledge your collaborators and the assistance they provided (e.g. including in your acknowledgements section a peer who proofread your work before you submitted it).

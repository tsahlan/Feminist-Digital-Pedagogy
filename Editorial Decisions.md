**Below is the documentation of the editorial choices and learning journey for this project. This is internal document so no head was made to grammar or format.**
1. Thought if this later create a template and copy copy to each page. But also, course notes were different based on day, but could work for readings and digital projects 
2. Decisions to keep citation as is presented on the course site and not a adapt a certain standard for citation like mla or apa, or Chicago.  Having everything linked allows for this "casual" attribution format
3. Need to revise sentences so it read for a larger public audience as opposed the class for example in week 2, I revised the wrote below and titled it freewrite activity. 
4. Consistency in format was a large concern, for example. Do I always have student initials after or before what they say or do I place their name in parenthesis or just a dash in front of it. 

Some of these may seem minor, but the goal is to create something for future work and something akin to a template 
5. Suggestions in the notes section were highlighted.  1. To indicate a suggestion and 2 to make locating to copy to suggested resource easier for me. I came to this decision while working on week 2 and so had to go back to week 1 and change the suggested text to bold. This back and forth... learning while doing although invigorating is time consuming. I realize that I am building a skill and accepting this trial and error is crucial as a pedagogue to encounter with technology so I as I work it I am able to critique it's usability and value in a course I may teach. Either creating a unit repository or github classroom or even a github page.
6. Some course notes were reorganized for example questions related to reading even if they were buried in the discussion were placed in a section called questions related to readings. 
7. New category was created to address collaboration in the course on what to focus on next. The section is called...what next?
8. Documenting while documenting 
9. Rereading the course notes and diving into them then realizing... oh the task is to document not contemplate.
10. Going back to previous weeks and checking in keep the format. For example in suggested resources I decided to add one liner to explain the resource but also only add the title and not a full citation for simplicity 

11. Project section was left as is
12. Readings were mostly left as is only editorial notes was added for readings not open access

13. In class notes, housekeeping that suggested dates or calls were not added. Only items that read like a session plan/recap were added , since the goal is to preserve the ideas and conversations and not the processes.

14. In week 4, If a reading was mentioned, notes for that reading was added under the section questions related to reading

Also,  discussion of projects were project designated to project discussion section  and the reading question was also a discussion in best practices so the discussion was moved to pedagogical best practices section with the question. So the question was separated from the discussion in the top section 

SO LOTS OF REARRANGING

15. Student names are initials,  instructor is called instructor in the notes 

16. At week 4, I realized it's best to break the subsection of the discussion section to heading 3

17. After course notes. Copy code and put in suggestions and delete all info expect suggested resources for ease

18. Questions that did not have a response were placed in the session plan to denote a framing question,  but it was only labeled as question 

19. Something i didn't discuss with the community is how to present the student lead discussions, so I decided to include only key words and questions from the students document and the discussion notes from the course notes 

Things to do:

Unit 2 and 3
Internal linking of pages
Some sort of tagging system

Think through:
1. Disability 
2. Minimal computing 
3. Citation 
4. Archiving

Be warned...if you want to create a documention of course notes where the audience is only a small community and transer it to a larger audiene, it will be time consuming! Teachers if you do this in class--do only one page and have a template ready. The cognitive labor takes more time than thte technical labor.
